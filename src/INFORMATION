You can add support for more plugins then only EssentialsX for the AFK-Hook manually. You can call the event
via the SupportChat main class -> de.spinanddrain.supportchat.spigot.SpigotPlugin#callAFKEvent
The method needs an 'AFKHook' Object. You can easily create a new instance of 'AFKHook'. Define in the constructor of the hook
which player should be affected and if he is going afk right now or getting back.

// true = is going afk right now
// false = is back

ForExample:

SpigotPlugin.provide().callAFKEvent(new AFKHook(Supporter.cast(player), true));
// Note: Supporter#cast returns null if the Player is not a supporter.
